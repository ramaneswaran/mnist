# MNIST Digit Recognition
MNIST Handwritten digit recognition in keras

The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students

## The Model

I referred to a blog post by Gregor Koehler for this project

[Click here for the blog post used](https://nextjournal.com/gkoehler/digit-recognition-with-keras "NEXT Journal")

The model trained for this project consists of one input layer, one hidden layer and one softmax output 
layer. The model is trained over 20 epochs using the Adam optimization method

## Perfomance

The model gave a test accuracy of 98%
